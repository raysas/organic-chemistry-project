`"this is a valid piece of code, no one can sue me for it" -a wise woman  ` 

**DISCLAIMER!** ***It's made for everyone, whether you code or you not, you love chemistry or you don't hate it :p, you can use this program to generate a structure of a chemical compound by only providing its IUPAC name***

Get an organic molecule's structure within litteraly a click of a button:  
All you have to do is just provide the full, and correct IUPAC name. The picture of the structure is also downloadable by clicking the save button.

## Instructions
Mainly, all what is required from the user is to go [here]("https://colab.research.google.com/github/raysas/organic_chemistry_project"), click on `ocp.ipnyb`, might need to sign in using a google account and then run the program by hitting the run button on Google Colab. The program will prompt the user to input an IUPAC name, once the user submits a structure should pop on the screen and can also be save as a .png file (photo)
